# ♻ WasteNot – Food Redistribution Platform

*WasteNot* is our hackathon project aimed at reducing food waste by connecting food donors (restaurants, homes, businesses) with NGOs who need it.  
This digital platform enables real-time food posting, claiming, and tracking — helping bridge the gap between surplus and scarcity.

## 🚀 What We're Building

- ✅ Donors can post excess edible food
