# ♻ WasteNot – Food Redistribution Platform

*WasteNot* is our hackathon project aimed at reducing food waste by connecting food donors (restaurants, homes, businesses) with NGOs who need it.  
This digital platform enables real-time food posting, claiming, and tracking — helping bridge the gap between surplus and scarcity.

---
## 🔍 Inspiration & Research

We have extensively researched the issue of *edible food waste* and its impact on both the environment and food insecurity.  
The name *“WasteNot”* is inspired by existing real-world initiatives and open-source efforts addressing similar challenges globally.  
We’re building a simplified and localized version tailored to our hackathon use case.

 💡 Problem Statement

Millions of tons of edible food are wasted due to the lack of coordination between food donors and recipients.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

Build a simple platform where donors can create accounts and eventually post food details — enabling NGOs or receivers to claim surplus food.

* Register a donor
* Log in securely
* View homepage and About Us

---

## 📌 Future Scope

* Donor-Food Listings
* Receiver-side Login & Listings View
* Admin Panel & Analytics
* Google Maps API for pickup location

> 📌 This repo will be updated continuously throughout the hackathon.

Stay tuned as we build WasteNot — a step toward zero food waste! 💚
